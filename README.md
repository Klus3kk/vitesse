# **Vitesse**  

**Vitesse** is a 16-bit RISC (Reduced Instruction Set Computer) processor, implemented using **VHDL (VHSIC Hardware Description Language)**. Designed with simplicity and educational value in mind, it focuses on executing fundamental arithmetic and logical operations efficiently.

## **Features**

- **16-bit ALU (Arithmetic Logic Unit):** Performs core arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction) and logical operations (AND, OR, NOT).  
- **Simple Instruction Set Architecture (ISA):** Features a streamlined set of instructions for arithmetic, logic, and data movement.  
- **Register File:** Includes a small set of general-purpose registers (e.g., 8 registers).  
- **Program Counter (PC):** Tracks the address of the next instruction to be executed.  
- **Control Unit:** Decodes instructions and orchestrates control signals for the processorâ€™s components.  
- **Memory Interface:** Provides connectivity to a basic RAM model for instruction and data storage.  
- **Single-Cycle Execution:** Executes one instruction per clock cycle for simplicity.

## **Technologies**

- **VHDL:** Hardware description language for processor implementation.  
- **GHDL:** Open-source simulator for testing and debugging VHDL designs.

**Status:** *In progress*
